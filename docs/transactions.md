A Cryptocurrency Transaction Protocol: Bitcoin vs. Nxt vs. Ethereum vs. Scorex Lagonaki
=======================================================================================

Bitcoin Transactional Model
-------------------------

Nxt Transactional Model
------------------------

Unlike Bitcoin, Nxt transaction has no multiple inputs and outputs, any scripts attached to 
a transaction. So a transaction encodes sender, optional receiver, monetary value to transfer
 and optional attachment possibly encoding some rules and data. For example, an attachment 
 could contain an operation with an asset: asset issuance, asset transfer etc. Please note all 
  asset-related attachments should be processed in the same way on all the nodes. 
 The Nxt approach lacks flexibility creators of other blockchains are usually proud of but 
 could provide maximum efficiency for certain kinds of applications.
