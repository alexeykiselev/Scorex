Scorex FAQ
==========

General
-------

**What is Lagonaki? How is it different from Scorex?**

Scorex is the basic framework to make experiment with the blockchain. 
It is about functional interfaces providing a possibility to replace a component seamlessly. 
  Lagonaki is concrete example blockchain application having a Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm
   and simplest token transfer transactions.    

**Who is behind the Scorex?**

The project was started by Nxt developer Alexander Chepurnoy(aka kushti). And we are welcome 
everyone's contribution!  
 
**What are the goals of the project?**





Addresses and Transactions
--------------------------

**What is the standard Bitshares address structure and format?**
    
**What public key system is used? If elliptic curve, then what is the curve?**
    
**Is there a specification for Bitshares scripting language? (assuming there is one)**
        
**Is the scripting language turing complete?**
    
**What transaction types are natively supported?**
    
**How is accounting addressed in Bitshares? Is it a Nxt style accounting model or like Bitcoin's UTXO**
    
**What is the average size in Bytes of a Bitshares transaction?**
    
**How are transactions validated?**
    
**Are there any special affordances made for privacy such as using CoinJoin or a 
ZK-SNARK based privacy scheme like Zerocash? If mixing is integrated at the protocl level are 
you using the standards set forth by the BNMCKF Mixcoin proposal?**


Blockchain Design
-----------------

**What data structures are used in the blockchain?**

**What is the format of the block header?**

**How do you guarantee liveness, correctness and consistency as the network changes state?**

**How are blockchain reorganizations addressed?**

**Being a trading system, what prevents front running?**

**What economic incentives do those promoting a correct state have for honest behavior?**

**Are there incentives for data relay?**

**What is an anticipated rate of growth for the Bitshares blockchain per day?**

**What is the maximum bitshares block size?**

**Are there any sharding mechanics currently deployed?**

**How are SPV clients handled?**

**Does the protocol provide mechanisms for overlay protocols to interact such as OR_RETURN?**

**How is time addressed in the blockchain? Is NTP used or some other protocol?**

**How do new clients bootstrap into the network?**

**What is the average block time? How long does it take for this block to propagate to 95 
percent of the network? Is this done via a gossip protocol or through a federate relay?**

**How do you address forks in the network? What level of byzantine fault tolerance 
does the network have given a Quorum set N?**


Development and Governance
--------------------------

**How many developers are actively working on the protocol? Where are they located and what 
is their stake in the project?**

**What is the protocol being developed in?**

**What development standards and methodologies are being deployed to ensure the code is high quality?**

**How is testing addressed? Do you have test suites and a test net?**

**Has Bitshares 2 gone through a security audit?**

**How are upgrades to the protocol handled? Is there an equivalent notion to BIPs from bitcoin? How can I propose new or changed code?**

**What license is Bitshares source code developed under? Is it compatible with the Free software foundation's notion of open source?**

**How are the Bitshares core developers documenting both the protocol and the source code? Is there an explicit method for how this should be done?**
